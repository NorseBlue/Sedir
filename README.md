Seidr is a framework agnostic package for easy XML data extraction.

It is inspired by [orchestral/parser](https://github.com/orchestral/parser).

### Package Naming

Seidr (pronounced “SAY-der;” Old Norse seiðr, “cord, string, snare”) is a form of pre-Christian Norse magic and shamanism concerned with discerning and altering the course of destiny by re-weaving part of destiny’s web. [[Norse mythology concepts](https://norse-mythology.org/concepts/seidr/)]

The name was chosen because the intent of the package is to feel a bit "magical" and the purpose is to re-weave the XML data into an array.
